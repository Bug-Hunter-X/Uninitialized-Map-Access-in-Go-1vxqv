# Uninitialized Map Access in Go

This example demonstrates a potential pitfall in Go when working with maps: accessing elements in an uninitialized map. In many other languages, this would result in a runtime error or exception. However, in Go, accessing a non-existent key in an uninitialized map simply returns the zero value for the map's value type.

This behavior might be unexpected and lead to subtle bugs if not handled properly. The example code shows how accessing the key "a" in an uninitialized map will print 0 instead of causing a panic.
